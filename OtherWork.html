						<p>At College, we held an annual event called "Tech Day". This is a day where students showcased their skills in their projects,that were chosen themselves, to businesses across the Island. <br>
							The tutors had no input on what the students could pick and choose. The time to prepare and create the projects were also fully independent, so good time management was needed.<br>
							Over the course of the two years, the group and I created a video games. For both years, I created all of the of the art and animations for the projects, as well as a lot of the coding behind the game, 
							like animation code and other game mechanics. I was also in charge of the overall audio for the game like music and SFX.<br>
							Above is a gameplay playthrough of the game we created in the first year of college, "The Detective Chronicles".
