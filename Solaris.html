							<p>Solaris is a first-person, pseudo-realistic exploration game set on the 
								desert planet of Karnagor. The game's focus on art and storytelling 
								help guide the player through a mysterious, subterranean construction 
								to unearth a shocking truth that threatens the reality of the people of Karnagor.

							<h2>Contribution:</h2>
							<h3>Programming - </h3>
							<p>Solaris was my first step into Unreal Engine 4, therefore this project was mainly taken as a learning experience, 
								to teach myself the core functionality and basics of the game engine. This meant that the overall complexity 
								was limited however the team and I still created a good demo based on what we knew at the time.<br>

								My main contribution, in terms of programming, was with the gameplay and the trigger events throughout the game, 
								as well as the implementation of the game's menus and UI. 
								During this project I also dabbled in level streaming for the first time, this turned out to be a bit out of my depth, however. 
								Although it was successfully implemented, it could have been done better.<br>

								I also took up the role of Audio Producer (music and SFX) and cinematic Artist (Trailer and in-game cinematics) 
								as I was the most comfortable with these roles in the team.  </p>

							<h3>Version Control - </h3>
							<p>This project was the first major team project in that I had used version control, and it was a vital learning experience for me and the rest of the team. <br>
								I was the dedicated "version control person" for Solaris, which means that any help needed by the rest of the team with any version control issues including 
								Git, TortoiseGit, Commit issues or anything else was handled by myself. I took on this role as I was the most comfortable with version control within the team. 
								This project made me research deeper into the correct workflows that should be done when using version control for future projects, such as <a href="Trial.html" style="color:#db5ac8">The Trial.</a>
